# Data Engineering Nanodegree

Projects and resources developed in the [DEND Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-engineer-nanodegree--nd027) from Udacity.

## Project 1: [Relational Databases - Data Modeling with PostgreSQL](https://github.com/packy6919A/nanodegree/tree/main/Project1-Data_Modeling_with_PostgreSQL).
Developed a relational database using PostgreSQL to model user activity data for a music streaming app. Skills include:
* Created a relational database using PostgreSQL
* Developed a Star Schema database using optimized definitions of Fact and Dimension tables. Normalization of tables.
* Built out an ETL pipeline to optimize queries in order to understand what songs users listen to.

Proficiencies include: Python, PostgreSql, Star Schema, ETL pipelines, Normalization


## Project 2: [NoSQL Databases - Data Modeling with Apache Cassandra](https://github.com/packy6919A/nanodegree/tree/main/Project2-Data_Modeling_with_Apache_Cassandra).
Designed a NoSQL database using Apache Cassandra based on the original schema outlined in project one. Skills include:
* Created a nosql database using Apache Cassandra (both locally and with docker containers)
* Developed denormalized tables optimized for a specific set queries and business needs

Proficiencies used: Python, Apache Cassandra, Denormalization

## Project 3: [Data Lake - Spark](https://github.com/packy6919A/nanodegree/tree/main/Project3-Data_Lake_on_AWS_S3)
Scaled up the current ETL pipeline by moving the data warehouse to a data lake. Skills include:
* Create an EMR Hadoop Cluster
* Further develop the ETL Pipeline copying datasets from S3 buckets, data processing using Spark and writing to S3 buckets using efficient partitioning and parquet formatting.
* Fast-tracking the data lake buildout using (serverless) AWS Lambda and cataloging tables with AWS Glue Crawler.

Technologies used: Spark, S3, EMR, Athena, Amazon Glue, Parquet.

## Project 4: [Data Pipelines - Airflow](https://github.com/packy6919A/nanodegree/tree/main/Project4-Data_Pipelines_with_Apache_Airflow)
Automate the ETL pipeline and creation of data warehouse using Apache Airflow. Skills include:
* Using Airflow to automate ETL pipelines using Airflow, Python, Amazon Redshift.
* Writing custom operators to perform tasks such as staging data, filling the data warehouse, and validation through data quality checks.
* Transforming data from various sources into a star schema optimized for the analytics team's use cases.

Technologies used: Apache Airflow, S3, Amazon Redshift, Python.
